# Dev backend lifecycle for Playwright-driven runs from stable.
#
# Why this exists: the dev checkout is the regression-test target. Its backend
# should be off by default and only come up when a Playwright spec running from
# stable needs to drive it. This script is the single, narrow path for that.
#
# Outside Playwright fixtures, prefer the parent devspace start-dev.sh /
# stop-dev.sh scripts when a human is debugging dev directly. This script
# deliberately handles only dev's backend on port 5030; it does not start the
# Angular dev server.
#
# Usage:
#   ./dev-lifecycle.sh start     # boot dev backend on :5030 (idempotent)
#   ./dev-lifecycle.sh stop      # shut dev backend down (idempotent)
#   ./dev-lifecycle.sh status    # exit 0 if healthy, 1 otherwise
#
# Env vars:
#   DEV_CHECKOUT   absolute path to the dev checkout (default: sibling folder
#                  agent-taskboard-dev next to the script's parent checkout).
#   DEV_PORT       backend port (default 5030).
