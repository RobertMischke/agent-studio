#!/usr/bin/env sh
# Hardened resume helper for the stable / dev runner. Use after any
# operation that may have raced the backend lifecycle (an update-stable run,
# a manual `api.sh restart`, etc.) so the resume PUT cannot be silently lost.
#
# What this script does, in order:
#   1. Wait for the target backend's /healthz to return 200 (60 s ceiling
#      by default; backend may answer 503 for some seconds during startup
#      and we treat that as "still booting", not "give up").
#   2. Auto-register a `service` identity at /api/clients/register if the
#      caller did not pass an existing X-Client-Id. The store is idempotent
#      on displayName, so re-registering the same id returns the same id.
#   3. PUT /api/runner/<project>/mode with mode=auto-continuous, sending
#      X-Client-Id (mutations require it since the client-identity boundary
#      landed; without it the call returns 401 and the runner silently
#      stays paused — that is the regression this script exists to prevent).
#   4. GET /api/runner/status and verify the named project reports
#      Mode == auto-continuous. If not, retry the PUT with exponential
#      backoff up to ATP_RESUME_MAX_ATTEMPTS times.
#
# The script exits 0 on a verified resume. It exits non-zero when the
# resume could not be verified after all retries; the caller is expected
# to surface that as a high-severity advisory rather than continue.
#
# Usage:
#   resume-runner.sh <project>                     # read defaults from env
#   ATP_API=http://127.0.0.1:5031 \
#   ATP_CLIENT_ID=supervisor-session \
#     resume-runner.sh agent-taskboard
#
# Env vars:
#   ATP_API                 backend base URL (default: http://127.0.0.1:5031)
#   ATP_CLIENT_ID           explicit identity to send (default: auto-register
#                           a `service` identity called "stable-restart-watcher")
#   ATP_CLIENT_DISPLAY      displayName used during auto-registration
#                           (default: stable-restart-watcher)
#   ATP_RESUME_MAX_ATTEMPTS resume PUT + verify attempts (default: 5)
#   ATP_RESUME_BACKOFF      base seconds between retries; doubles each time
#                           (default: 2)
#   ATP_HEALTHZ_TIMEOUT     seconds to wait for /healthz=200 (default: 60)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  resume verified
#   2  fatal misconfiguration (missing project arg, missing curl)
#   3  /healthz never returned 200 within ATP_HEALTHZ_TIMEOUT
#   4  identity registration failed
#   5  resume could not be verified after ATP_RESUME_MAX_ATTEMPTS
