# Your first task

Once a project is attached ([onboard-a-project.md](./onboard-a-project.md)) and at least one CLI is installed ([onboard-an-agent-cli.md](./onboard-an-agent-cli.md)), queue a small first task to confirm the loop works end to end. The goal is to watch a real run: pickup, CLI invocation, log streaming, lane transition, auto-commit, auto-review.

## A good first task

Pick something **small**, **scoped**, and **read-then-write**: the agent has to look at real files and produce a real diff. This exercises the load-bearing surfaces (Git status, prompt rendering, model selection, sentinel emission, lane transition, commit stamping) without making you wait 20 minutes for a real feature.

The pattern that has worked well on every new project so far is the **Project Overview Doc**:

> Title: `docs: add Project Overview doc`
>
> Prompt:
> ```
> Read the repository's existing README and top-level folders to understand
> what this project is. Write a short overview at docs/project-overview.md
> covering:
> - what the project does (1 paragraph)
> - the main folders and what lives in each
> - how to run it locally (commands only, no setup theory)
>
> Keep it under 80 lines. End your reply with [[TASK_DONE]].
> ```
> Type: `Chore` &middot; State: `2-ready` &middot; CLI: whichever you want to test

What you should see:

1. The card appears in `2-ready`. The runner picks it up within ~5 s in `auto-continuous` mode (or you click Start in `manual` mode).
2. The card moves to `3-progress`. The Activity Log streams tool calls live: `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`, then `Write`.
3. The agent emits `[[TASK_DONE]]`. The runner records the lane-transition commit (when `AutoCommit` is on), moves the card to `4-auto-review`, and the orchestrator decides accept / re-issue.
4. The card lands in `5-human-review` for your final sign-off. The protocol view shows the prompt, the activity log, the per-run summary, and the commit.

## Anti-patterns

Tasks that look small but make the loop tell you nothing:

| Don't queue | Why |
|---|---|
| `was-ist-1-plus-1` / single-line answers | The agent answers in chat and exits without touching a file. No diff, no commit, no real signal that the loop works. |
| "Refactor module X" without a brief | Open-ended scope; agent flails, the run is long, the failure mode is unclear. |
| "Run all tests and report" | The agent doesn't know the test runner's quirks on day one; the run produces a noisy log without exercising the write path. |
| Anything that requires non-trivial repo conventions | Day-one tasks should not double as onboarding for the agent. Pick something that works from a cold read of the README. |

## Where to watch

- **Board view** (`http://localhost:4010`) shows the card moving lanes. Drag-and-drop is optimistic with a snapshot-revert path.
- **Detail panel** (click the card): prompt, status, live activity log with tool-call ticker, live `git diff` once the agent starts writing.
- **Run timeline**: one card per CLI invocation between user inputs. Useful when a job has been continued multiple times.
- **`logs/cli-output.log`** inside the job folder: the raw CLI stdout/stderr buffer. Look here when the UI parser drops something you saw the model say.

## Creating tasks programmatically

When you need to script task creation (bulk seed, follow-up batches, triage scripts), use the Task API rather than the create dialog. The full contract, the `watchPath` quirk, the `X-Client-Id` header, and ready-to-use Node templates live in [../../.agents/skills/job-api/SKILL.md](../../../.agents/skills/job-api/SKILL.md).

A minimal create looks like:

```js
// scripts ship in .agents/skills/job-api/scripts/
const watchPaths = await fetch('http://127.0.0.1:5030/api/watch-paths').then(r => r.json());
const target = watchPaths.find(w => w.name === 'Lotta Dashboard');

await fetch('http://127.0.0.1:5030/api/tasks', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'X-Client-Id': 'local-default' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    watchPath: target.path,   // resolved job-folder root, NOT rootPath
    title: 'docs: add Project Overview doc',
    promptMarkdown: '...',
    agent: 'claude',
    cliType: 'claude',
    targetState: '2-ready',
  }),
});
```

The Task API skill is **mandatory** before any scripted board mutation; the `watchPath` vs. `rootPath` distinction trips up every new operator at least once. Keep `agent` and `cliType` on the same real CLI value (`claude`, `codex`, `copilot`, or `gemini`).

## What "the loop works" actually means

If you can queue the Project Overview task, watch it pass through `2-ready -> 3-progress -> 4-auto-review -> 5-human-review`, and read the resulting `docs/project-overview.md` in the diff pane, the install is healthy. From there, scale up: queue real features, set `auto-continuous`, walk away.

If something goes sideways - the card pauses, two cards end up in `3-progress`, the counters look wrong, the agent emits only sandbox errors - check [troubleshooting.md](./troubleshooting.md) before opening a bug.
