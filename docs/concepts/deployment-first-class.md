# Deployment as a first-class citizen

Status: concept and initial workflow implemented, 2026-07-11. The shared
Deployment contract now includes DEP-1 history and DEP-2 repository-derived
targets. Runnable deploy-stable and descriptor targets launch normal visible
CLI tasks (DEP-3), and the first bounded PDU compiler turns repository-script
commands with declared typed slots into a human-reviewed run form. Package
release targets remain delegated to Publishing. The richer shared live-progress
presentation and broader natural-language compiler remain future refinements.

Promotion of the complete integration stream and the separate stable freeze use
the decided [release-semantics contract](release-semantics.md). Deployment owns
the project-specific executable steps; it does not redefine acceptance or hide
unreviewed work from a release manifest.

Mockup:
[mockups/deployment-first-class.html](mockups/deployment-first-class.html).

## Decision in one paragraph

**Deployment becomes a first-class per-project surface, the way Project URLs
already are.** Every project gets a **Deployment page** that shows its deploy
targets, their current state, and their run history. The known cases are modeled
as **scenario templates** (the Studio `deploy-stable` cycle, a Caddy site deploy
on the `agent-orchestrator-web` VM, and a NuGet/npm release via tag push). Where
no template fits, the operator describes the deployment as a **prompt**, and the
prompt is compiled into a small **dynamic UI** (fields, parameters, one run
button) for launching concrete deploys. Every actual run - template or
prompt-defined - executes through the existing **visible CLI-task substrate**
(AGT-2093), so progress, chat, operator input, and durable history come for
free. The read-only start (DEP-1: a Deployment page that renders the existing
`deploy-stable` history from git and logs) is small; the template runner and the
prompt-to-UI compiler are separate later slices.

## 1. Why deployment is a product object

Deployment is real, recurring work that today lives entirely outside the
product. It happens in a terminal, from memory, per project:

- the Studio itself ships through the `deploy-stable` cycle - the devspace-level
  `update-stable.sh` stops stable, pulls, and restarts, driven by
  [`restart-stable-after-batch.sh`](../../scripts/supervisor/restart-stable-after-batch.sh),
  which already appends a structured record to
  `<workspace>/logs/stable-restarts.jsonl` per restart;
- a public site is served by a reverse proxy (Caddy) on the
  `agent-orchestrator-web` VM
  ([linux-runner-host](../operations/setup/linux-runner-host.md) documents the
  same-origin `/api` + `/hubs` reverse-proxy shape);
- packages ship through a tag-push release picked up by an existing GitHub
  Actions workflow, already modeled read-only by
  [publishing workflows](publishing-workflows.md) (PUB-1 / PUB-2).

Deployment is **super fuzzy**: it differs per project and resists one universal
model. What changed is the substrate. AGT-2093 gives us **lightweight,
first-class CLI tasks with full visibility** - the same object the Remote Hosts
onboarding already reuses (AGT-2094): "the action creates a normal visible CLI
task, so the existing task conversation owns live output, operator input,
completion, and durable history"
([linux-runner-host](../operations/setup/linux-runner-host.md)). Once a deploy
run *is* a visible CLI task, deployment stops needing its own execution engine.
It needs a **page to see it**, **templates for the known shapes**, and a **way to
describe the unknown ones** - which is exactly this concept.

The user-facing name is **Deployment** (a project surface). A single configured
deploy path is a **target**; one execution is a **run**. This mirrors the
publishing vocabulary (target / run) so the two surfaces read as siblings, not
rivals.

## 2. The three shapes of deployment

Deployment splits cleanly into three shapes. The product models all three with
one page and one execution substrate; only the *definition* of a run differs.

| Shape | Where the run definition comes from | First examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Template** | A repository-recognized pattern with a known parameter set. | `deploy-stable` cycle, Caddy site deploy, NuGet/npm tag-push release. |
| **Prompt** | An operator prompt compiled into a dynamic UI. | Any project-specific deploy that no template matches. |
| **Derived (read-only)** | Facts already in git and logs, shown without a run action. | `deploy-stable` history from `stable-restarts.jsonl`; publish deltas from PUB-1. |

The derived shape is deliberately first: it is honest, safe, and immediately
useful, and it is what DEP-1 ships.

## 3. Scenario templates (the known cases)

A **template** is a named deploy shape with a small, typed parameter set and a
single command path, executed as a CLI task. Templates are how we avoid asking
the operator to re-describe a deployment the product already understands.

The three first templates are modeled on processes that exist today. They are
descriptions of reality, not new automation:

### 3.1 `deploy-stable` cycle (Studio self-deploy)

The Studio ships to its own stable seat. Stable never restarts itself
(ADR-0021); an external watcher counts new jobs in the review lane, checks that
stable is idle, then runs `update-stable.sh` and records the outcome.

- **Parameters:** target seat (stable), restart threshold (informational), a
  confirmation that stable is idle.
- **Run:** a CLI task that invokes the existing update script and streams its
  output; on success it verifies the runner resumed
  ([`resume-runner.sh`](../../scripts/supervisor/resume-runner.sh)).
- **History source:** `logs/stable-restarts.jsonl` (`headBefore`, `headAfter`,
  `jobsSinceLastRestart`, `durationSeconds`, `status`) plus the git range between
  the two HEADs. This is the DEP-1 read-only view - it needs no new run action.

### 3.2 Caddy site deploy (`agent-orchestrator-web` VM)

A public site is deployed behind a Caddy reverse proxy on a remote VM. The
deploy is a build plus a file sync plus a proxy reload on the host.

- **Parameters:** target host, source branch, site path, whether to reload the
  proxy.
- **Run:** a CLI task that executes the deploy over SSH on the remote host - the
  same remote-command pattern the Remote Hosts onboarding already uses through
  [`remote-runner-onboard.sh`](../../scripts/remote-runner-onboard.sh).
- **History source:** the CLI-task run history for this target, plus the deployed
  revision recorded per run.
- **Routing vs publishing.** A site published by a **workflow** (GitHub Pages /
  `deploy-pages`) is a *publishing* website target and stays owned by
  [publishing workflows](publishing-workflows.md) (PUB-1). A site deployed to a
  **host over SSH** (Caddy / rsync) is a *deployment* template target. The
  trigger mechanism - workflow versus host command - decides which surface owns
  a given site; the two never derive the same site twice.

### 3.3 NuGet / npm release via tag push

A package ships when a `vX.Y.Z` tag is pushed and an existing GitHub Actions
workflow publishes it. This template does not re-implement publishing; it is the
**launch surface** over the derivation and guarded actions that
[publishing workflows](publishing-workflows.md) already own.

- **Parameters:** ecosystem (derived), suggested next version (editable),
  release notes source.
- **Run:** delegates to the PUB-2 guided action (clean-worktree check, manifest
  bump, one release commit, atomic `HEAD` + tag push). The product never runs
  `npm publish` / `dotnet nuget push`; Trusted Publishing and the workflow stay
  authoritative.
- **History source:** the target's release tags and workflow-dispatch run
  status, already surfaced by PUB-1.

Templates are **derived from repository facts plus a repository-owned
descriptor**, never from an opaque setting stored outside the repo. Fact-only
derivation holds for the derived and release shapes; a host-bound template such
as Caddy additionally needs a small repository-owned descriptor for its host and
site path (§6), because SSH host identity is environment, not a repo fact. A
project that has none of these shapes simply shows no templates rather than an
invented one.

## 4. Prompt to dynamic UI (the individual case)

Most projects will have at least one deploy that no template matches. Instead of
forcing every such case into a bespoke feature, the operator **describes the
deployment in a prompt**, and the prompt is compiled into a **dynamic UI**: a
small set of typed fields, sensible defaults, and one run button. Submitting the
UI launches a CLI task with the resolved values.

The flow:

1. **Describe.** The operator writes a prompt: "Deploy the docs site: build with
   `pnpm build`, rsync `dist/` to `web@vm:/srv/docs`, reload Caddy. Let me pick
   the branch and choose whether to purge the CDN."
2. **Compile.** The product extracts a **UI schema** from the prompt - a bounded
   list of typed parameters (branch: enum of branches; purge-CDN: boolean;
   confirm: required), a human title, and a command intent. The schema is
   reviewable and editable; the operator confirms it before it becomes a
   reusable definition.
3. **Persist.** The confirmed definition is saved as a repository-owned deploy
   descriptor (see §6) - so the dynamic UI is now a stable, versioned target,
   not a one-off.
4. **Run.** Filling the fields substitutes the values into the compiled command
   template and launches it as a CLI task. Progress, chat, and history are the
   CLI task's, exactly like a template run.

The safety boundary is worth stating precisely, because "the UI has no execution
authority" is true but not the interesting claim - the interesting question is
what the *executor* is allowed to do. A PDU does **not** compile to a free-form
agent prompt (which would be unbounded shell); it compiles to a **bounded
command template with typed slots** - the same shape as a §3 template, only
authored from a prompt instead of recognized from repo facts. The dynamic UI
fills the slots; it never rewrites the command. Classifying an ask as
"dangerous" is a **compile-time, human-reviewed** step, not a runtime model
judgement: the compiler reduces the prompt to a bounded command and **flags
anything it cannot bound** (raw shell, an unpinned secret, a destructive verb),
and the operator sees and edits the template before it is saved or run. An ask
the compiler cannot bound stays flagged until the operator resolves it; it never
silently degrades into a free agent prompt. This is deliberately **weaker** than
a code-pinned template, and the card owns that cost: a PDU trades the correctness
guarantee of a pinned command path for flexibility, and its safety rests on human
review of a bounded template, not on the substrate.

## 5. Meta-pattern: dynamic UI from a prompt

"Compile a prompt into a small dynamic UI, then execute through the CLI-task
substrate" is a **reusable product pattern**, not a deployment-only trick. It
will recur wherever a task is *shaped* (has a small, stable parameter set) but
not *templated* (common enough to hard-code). Deployment is its first home; the
same pattern fits ad-hoc maintenance jobs, data backfills, and one-off
operational runs.

Name it explicitly so later work reuses it rather than reinventing it:
**Prompt-defined dynamic UI (PDU)**. Its contract:

- **Input:** a natural-language prompt plus the project context.
- **Output:** a bounded, typed UI schema (fields, types, defaults, required
  flags, a title, a command intent) that a human reviews and edits.
- **Persistence:** the confirmed schema is repository content, versioned and
  diffable - not a hidden model artifact.
- **Execution:** always the CLI-task substrate. The compiled artifact is a
  bounded command template with typed slots, not a free-form agent prompt; the
  UI fills slots and never holds execution authority.

### When template, when prompt

| Use a **template** when | Use a **prompt UI** when |
|---|---|
| The shape is recognized from repo facts (workflow, script, manifest). | No template matches and the deploy is project-specific. |
| The parameter set is known and shared across projects. | The parameters are idiosyncratic to this one project. |
| Correctness matters enough to pin the command path in code. | Flexibility matters more than a fixed command path. |
| Examples: `deploy-stable`, Caddy site, tag-push release. | Examples: bespoke rsync deploy, a custom migration run. |

A prompt UI that proves common across projects is a candidate to **graduate into
a template**. That promotion is a normal feature decision, not an automatic
step. This meta-pattern also belongs in the public working-model chapter of the
website/docs, described as one of the ways Agent Studio turns intent into
governed, visible work.

## 6. Object and storage contract

A project's deploy configuration is repository content, consistent with how
[workbenches](experimentier-workbench.md) and the
[wiki tree](../system/contracts/wiki-tree.md) store their objects as physical folders
rather than a virtual registry:

```text
docs/deployments/
  docs-site/
    deployment.json                  # target descriptor (schema + lifecycle)
    prompt.md                        # optional, the source prompt for a PDU target
```

`deployment.json` is the small query and lifecycle contract:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "id": "docs-site",
  "title": "Docs site (Caddy on agent-orchestrator-web)",
  "kind": "template",
  "template": "caddy-site",
  "summary": "Build and sync the docs site, reload the proxy.",
  "parameters": [
    { "name": "branch", "type": "branch", "required": true },
    { "name": "purgeCdn", "type": "boolean", "default": false }
  ],
  "targetHostId": "agent-orchestrator-web",
  "updatedAt": "2026-07-11T10:30:00Z"
}
```

| Field | Values | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `kind` | `template`, `prompt`, `derived` | Which of the three shapes defines runs. |
| `template` | template id | Present when `kind` is `template`. |
| `parameters[].type` | `string`, `boolean`, `branch`, `enum`, `secret-ref` | Typed capture; `secret-ref` names a host secret, never stores it. |

Derived targets (like `deploy-stable` history) need no descriptor at all - they
are computed from git and logs. Descriptors exist only for targets that have a
run action. There is no `registry.json`; the folders are the model. Runs
themselves are **not** stored here: a run is a CLI task, and its record lives in
the task store, referenced by task key.

## 7. Execution is always a CLI task

Every deploy run is a normal visible CLI task (AGT-2093). This is the load-
bearing decision that makes deployment cheap to add:

- **Progress, chat, and history are free.** The task conversation already owns
  live output, operator input, completion, and durable history. Deployment does
  not build a second progress model.
- **The Deployment page launches and links, it does not execute.** Pressing run
  from a template or a prompt UI creates a CLI task through the existing task
  mutation boundary and then shows that task's live surface. The page is a
  launcher and a history view over deploy-tagged tasks.
- **Secrets stay on the host.** A `secret-ref` parameter names a
  host-managed secret; the product injects nothing. GitHub authorization for the
  release template comes from the operator's `gh` session, exactly as
  publishing-workflows requires.
- **The running deploy uses the CLI-progress pattern.** A live deploy renders in
  the same progress/step/chat layout as any CLI task, so operators already know
  how to read it. The mockup demonstrates this third view.

What the substrate gives for free is the **plumbing** - progress, chat, live
output, and durable history. It does **not** give deploy *correctness*: the
command path, host secrets, a health check, and rollback on failure are still
per-target work that each template (or PDU command) must get right. This concept
makes deployment cheap to *see and launch*; the hard parts of a specific deploy
stay as hard as they are.

## 8. Deployment page (read-only first)

Under each expanded project, **Deployment** is a first-class Explorer row (a
sibling of Wiki, Workbenches, and Project Hub), and a full-bleed page when
opened. The page has three regions:

Project Overview may render a compact last-deploy and pending-delta summary as
an entry point to this page. That block consumes the same DEP-1 summary contract
as Deployment itself. It does not parse `stable-restarts.jsonl` or git again,
persist a second last-deploy truth, or gain a separate run action.

```text
+-- Deployment (project) ---------------------------------------------+
| Targets            | History                                        |
|  deploy-stable  ●  |  vX @ab12  ->  @cd34   3 tasks   42s   ok       |
|  docs-site (Caddy) |  ...                                           |
|  NuGet 0.3.1       |                                                |
|  + Describe a deploy (prompt)                                       |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

- **Targets** lists derived + templated + prompt targets, each with a quiet
  status (dot or tint, never a colored left bar -
  [style-guide R1](../quality/design/style-guide-hard-rules.md)).
- **History** shows recent runs for the selected target. For `deploy-stable`
  this is read straight from `stable-restarts.jsonl` and the git range; no run
  action is required.
- **Describe a deploy** opens the prompt-to-UI flow (§4).

Counts reconcile to visible children (R3). Settled runs render quietly; only a
currently-running deploy carries an acute signal (R4). Both themes, keyboard
access, reduced motion (R5). The page never centers itself in a narrow column
(R2).

## 9. Invariants and non-goals

- Deploy targets are derived from repository facts and repository-owned
  descriptors, never from opaque stored settings.
- Every run executes as a visible CLI task; deployment owns no second execution
  engine, progress model, or scheduler.
- The Deployment page and any prompt-compiled UI capture parameters and launch
  tasks; they never hold credentials, secrets, or direct execution authority. A
  PDU compiles to a bounded command template with typed slots, never a free-form
  agent prompt.
- Secrets are named by reference and stay host-managed; the product injects
  none.
- The release template delegates to publishing-workflows; the product never runs
  `npm publish` or `dotnet nuget push`.
- Derived/read-only history is shown without inventing numbers; when there is no
  reliable record the page stays quiet (matching PUB-1's discipline).
- Aggregate counts equal visible children; settled runs are calm; both themes,
  keyboard, narrow layouts, reduced motion, and no colored left accent bars are
  part of every slice.
- The first version is not a CD platform, a pipeline engine, an environment
  promotion graph, a secret store, or an approval-workflow system.

## 10. Boundary with adjacent systems

| Object | Primary question | Owns | Relationship to deployment |
|---|---|---|---|
| Publishing workflows | Is something publishable, and ship it? | Package + workflow-published site target derivation + guarded release actions (PUB-1/2). | The release template is a launcher over it; host/SSH sites are deployment's, workflow/Pages sites stay publishing's. |
| [Project URLs / iframe](distributed-agent-studio-target-architecture.md) | Where does the running result live? | Configured per-project URLs and previews (AGT-2095). | A deploy target may point at a Project URL to preview the deployed result. |
| Workbenches | What should we see and decide? | Repository HTML experiments + decision-to-task (AGT-2084). | A deploy prompt is a decision that spawns a run, not an experiment. |
| Remote Hosts onboarding | Provision a runner host. | Visible-CLI-task provisioning over SSH (AGT-2094). | Same CLI-task substrate and same remote-command pattern as a Caddy deploy. |
| CLI-task substrate | Run and see one command. | Lightweight visible CLI tasks (AGT-2093). | The execution layer for every deploy run. |

Deployment is the **launch-and-history surface**; publishing owns package/site
release actions; the CLI-task substrate owns execution; Project URLs own the
live result. Deployment does not absorb any of them.

## 11. Implementation slices and honest size

The complete feature is **large**: it crosses repository discovery, a new
Explorer surface and page, template runners, a prompt-to-UI compiler, task
mutation, and read-only history over two data sources. It should be an Epic or
coordinated card family, not one coding card. The first read-only cut is small.

| Slice | Honest size | Scope | Acceptance boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| **DEP-1: Deployment page, `deploy-stable` history (read-only)** | M | Add the Explorer row and page; render `deploy-stable` runs from `stable-restarts.jsonl` + the git HEAD range. No run action. | History reconciles to the log; empty/missing log stays quiet; the per-row git range is batched/cached (no per-row git spawn - see the AGT-2007 git-info work); both themes; no left accent bars; no execution path. |
| **DEP-2: Template targets, read-only** | M | Implemented: derive tag-push-release targets via Publishing, deploy-stable from repository facts, and host/SSH targets from repository-owned descriptors. | The shared summary returns no invented target when facts or descriptors are absent; workflow-published websites stay Publishing's. |
| **DEP-3: Template run over the CLI-task substrate** | M/L | Implemented: parameter capture and confirmation launch deploy-stable and runnable descriptor targets through `VisibleCliTaskService`. | The action creates a normal Ready task through the existing mutation boundary; secrets remain references; release targets delegate to Publishing. |
| **DEP-4: Prompt-to-dynamic-UI compiler (PDU)** | L | Initial bounded compiler implemented: a prompt declaring a repository script command and typed slots renders a review form and launches through the same CLI-task substrate. Descriptor persistence and richer natural-language extraction remain follow-up scope. | Shell chaining, redirection, undeclared slots, and commands outside `scripts/*.sh` are surfaced as non-runnable warnings. |
| **DEP-5: Running-deploy view in the CLI-progress pattern** | S/M | Present a live deploy in the shared CLI-task progress/step/chat layout from the Deployment page. | Reuses the existing CLI-task live surface; acute only while running; settles quietly into history. |

DEP-4 is the risk-bearing slice (prompt-to-schema extraction, safety review,
persistence). DEP-1 and DEP-2 are safe read-only starts that deliver value
before any run action exists. Dependency order: DEP-1 -> DEP-2 -> DEP-3, with
DEP-4 after DEP-3 and DEP-5 alongside DEP-3.

## 12. Feature handoff status

The concept began as a production-code-free handoff, but the first workflow is
now implemented. DEP-1 and DEP-2 share one backend projection for history and
repository-derived targets. DEP-3 launches runnable targets as normal Ready CLI
tasks, and the bounded first DEP-4 compiler turns a repository-script command
with declared typed slots into the same reviewed run form. The remaining
follow-ups are descriptor persistence, broader natural-language extraction, and
the richer shared live-progress presentation described in DEP-5.

## 13. Second-opinion pass

An independent product and architecture review was applied on 2026-07-11. It
challenged the first draft on scope creep, execution ownership, prompt safety,
site-derivation ownership, and honest read-only limits. The resulting changes
are part of this concept:

- deployment explicitly owns **no execution engine**; every run is a CLI task,
  and the page is a launcher plus history view, not a runtime;
- the release template **delegates** to publishing-workflows, and §3.2 adds an
  explicit **site-ownership routing rule** (workflow/Pages sites are
  publishing's; host/SSH Caddy sites are deployment's) so no site derives twice;
- the prompt-to-UI safety story was sharpened: a PDU compiles to a **bounded
  command template with typed slots, not a free-form agent prompt**, danger
  classification is a **compile-time human-reviewed** step, and the card now
  **owns that a PDU is weaker than a code-pinned template** rather than implying
  parity;
- "derived from repo facts, never a stored setting" was corrected to **facts
  plus a repository-owned descriptor**, because a Caddy host/SSH identity is
  environment, not a repo fact; DEP-2's acceptance is scoped accordingly;
- §7 now states plainly that the substrate gives **plumbing, not deploy
  correctness** (command paths, secrets, health check, rollback stay per-target
  work), so "cheap to add" is not oversold;
- secrets are **named by reference and stay host-managed**; the product injects
  none; the read-only history is **quiet when there is no reliable record**,
  matching PUB-1's no-invented-numbers discipline;
- DEP-1 was re-rated **M** with a git-batching acceptance clause (the AGT-2007
  hazard), DEP-1/DEP-2 stay **read-only** so the first cut ships value without
  any run path, and DEP-4 is the single large risk slice.

The interactive mockup demonstrates the three views (Deployment page with
templates, prompt-to-dynamic-UI, and a running deploy in the CLI-progress
pattern). Its simulated run output and compiled schema are illustrative, not
product behavior.
