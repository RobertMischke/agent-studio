# Orchestrator in-app: the operator moves inside

Status: concept v1, 2026-07-10. ORCH-1 sight is implemented by the
context digest described below. The per-turn context envelope, bounded
continuity, central Task Server transcript, and source receipt were accepted on
2026-08-10. ORCH-2 and ORCH-3 remain future work.

The target is an in-app orchestrator chat that can keep the application
running while it lives inside that application. The app is no longer only the
patient observed by an external operator. The chat receives the same compact
operational picture the operator uses to understand the board.

## Three pillars

### Sight

The orchestrator receives a current, read-only application digest with:

- lane counts and the latest lane transitions;
- active runs and their lifecycle phase;
- cached CLI quota windows;
- PUB-1 publish-target status;
- backend and filesystem-watcher health;
- recent decision-journal verdicts.

The digest follows the multichat context key. `global` includes all registered
projects, `project:<project>` includes only that project, and
`task:<project>/<task>` adds a focused task row to the same project-scoped
facts, and `dossier:<project>/<dossier>` preserves the same project isolation
for a Dossier transcript. Scoped contexts must never leak facts from other
projects, and digest facts never become cross-context transcript continuity.

The representation is bounded and model-oriented rather than a raw API dump.
Noisy event sections have fixed row caps, long text is truncated, raw quota
samples and full decision prompts or responses are excluded, and capped event
headings state the applied limit. Lane and publish summaries retain one compact
row per in-scope project so global context does not silently omit a project.
Normal turns use cheap live facts plus cached quota data.
An explicit refresh may run the expensive quota probes before rebuilding the
same digest.

The digest is one backend service shared by the visible side-sheet chat and the
context-session turn API. This prevents two orchestrator entry points from
developing different views of application state.

### Turn-level context contract

ORCH-1 is one automatic evidence layer inside a typed context envelope. Every
stateless side-sheet send snapshots the conversation scope, active surface,
explicit stable references, token budget, and capture time. The backend binds
scope to the route, rejects cross-project and unsafe repository references
before model invocation, and resolves source content at the execution checkout.

Prompt assembly is fixed: scoped preamble, source ledger, automatic evidence,
explicit attachments, four to eight recent semantic turns, and the new user
message last. Automatic context uses a 4,000-token soft cap and 6,000-token hard
cap. Explicit sources may expand the total context envelope to 8,000 tokens.

Every reply persists an append-only source receipt linked to the corresponding
user turn. It records stable ids, revisions or hashes, freshness, inclusion and
omission state, character and token estimates, and budget. Resolved source
bodies do not enter the receipt.

Project, task, and Dossier transcript authority is the central Task Server.
Every project context is permanent. Opening task or Dossier Chat materializes a
managed context; task archive and Dossier archived/documented states hide it
without deleting its turns. Chat History reads the central current-context list
and compact summaries. Machine-local
`.orchestrator/orchestrator-chat.jsonl` is an idempotent migration source only.
The task detail Activity tab remains the unchanged task-agent execution surface.

### Hands

ORCH-2 will add journaled operational tools for reconciliation, requeue,
park/promote, post-processing restart, publish, and parallelism changes. It is
not part of ORCH-1. ORCH-1 does not grant mutation authority.

### Anchor and standing orders

ORCH-3 will capture standing operational policy and the minimal outside anchor
needed when the host itself is unavailable. Host-death recovery remains outside
the in-app chat for now.

## Slice boundaries

| Slice | Scope | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| ORCH-1 | Complete, scoped read context and on-demand refresh | Multichat context keys |
| ORCH-2 | Journaled intervention tools | ORCH-1 |
| ORCH-3 | Standing-orders policy and outside anchor | ORCH-2 |
