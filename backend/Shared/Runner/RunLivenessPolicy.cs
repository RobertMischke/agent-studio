/// Pure decision core for Run-Liveness Slice A (see

/// question for a single <c>3-progress</c> card: given whether it still has a
/// live run-heartbeat, whether its core agent run already finished, and how
/// long it has been silent, what must the runner do so that
/// <b>no zombie survives 60s</b>?
///
/// <para>
/// Invariant (concept Rule 4): every <c>3-progress</c> card needs a live
/// run-heartbeat. The heartbeat source is PHASE-AWARE - during execution the
/// live CLI process is the heartbeat; during post-processing the post-step
/// executor is. A card whose owning run process is gone is a zombie and must
/// leave <c>3-progress</c> within 60s.
/// </para>

/// <para>
/// The recovery is also phase-aware, which is why this is not a single "demote
/// everything" rule:
/// <list type="bullet">
///   <item><b>Execution interrupted</b> (no heartbeat, core run never finished -
///   belegt AGT-2006): demote to <c>2-ready</c> with reason
///   <see cref="RunLivenessReasons.ProcessLost"/> so a fresh run retries the
///   same task. The caller clears the session-resume pointer so the retry does
///   not walk into the "No conversation found" / "no rollout found" launch-fail
///   chain.</item>
///   <item><b>Post-processing interrupted</b> (no heartbeat but the agent run
