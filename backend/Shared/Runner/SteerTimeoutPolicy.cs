/// Pure decision core for Run-Liveness Slice B - the steer-timeout invariant

/// Answers one question for a single <c>3-progress</c> card that is waiting on
/// an unanswered steer / <c>[[TASK_NEEDS_INPUT]]</c> question: given how long it
/// has waited, its configured timeout, and whether the task context yields an
/// unambiguous answer, what must the runner
/// do so that <b>no steered card waits indefinitely</b>?
///
/// <para>
/// Belegt (2026-07-10): three cards (2062/2067/2068) hung in parallel ~5 hours
/// on steer questions whose answer was already knowable from the branch state
/// ("is this already implemented?" - their work was long since merged). The
/// runs waited unbounded because the NeedsInput wait had no timeout; the loss
/// was invisible because no lane moved. Slice A demotes a card whose PROCESS is
/// gone; a steered card is different - it is waiting on purpose, so it is
/// excluded from the Slice A heartbeat check and needs its own bounded wait.
