/**

 * them, but they must not count toward — or clutter — the Files tab. Names
 * are matched case-insensitively.
 *
 * This is the full set of machinery `.md` files the backend writes into a
 * task folder root (verified against `backend/` — every other
 * `orchestrator-*.md` / `runner-*.md` name is a prompt template under
 * `prompts/`, never a job-folder file):
 *
 *   - `orchestrator-follow-up.md` — the reissue reason the review
 *     orchestrator writes for the pickup runner (see backend
 *     `ReviewDecisionOrchestrator` / `ProjectRunner`). Surfaced in the
 *     Timeline / decision UI, not a "file" the operator dropped.
 *   - `failed-pickup-reason.md` — why a pickup was abandoned; written into
 *     the `failed-pickup/<slug>/` folder root (see `TaskAccessService`).
 *   - `archive-reason.md` — why a task was archived; written into the
 *     `archive/<slug>/` folder root (see `TaskAccessService`).
 *
 * (`status.md` is already dropped server-side because it owns the
 * Protocol tab, so it never reaches this filter.)

 * Per-detail Files-tab manifest. Owns the list of user-relevant `.md`
 * artifacts in the job root (prompt + aspect verdicts + code-review +
 * notes) that the Files tab renders and the Files-tab count badge sums.
 *
 * Internal machinery is kept out of the manifest so the badge counts what
 * an operator would call a "file": subfolders (`logs/`, `results/`,
 * `attachments/`) and non-`.md` state (`lifecycle.json`,
 * `pipeline-execution.json`, `*.jsonl`) are already excluded by the
 * backend `/artifacts` endpoint (top-level `*.md` + `aspect-*.json` only,
 * minus `status.md`); the remaining machinery `.md` files that DO sit in
 * the job/state-folder root — {@link MACHINERY_ARTIFACT_NAMES} — are
 * stripped here in {@link applyResponse}. Without this the badge
 * over-counted (the "kaputt" 9): the orchestrator follow-up file inflated
 * every reissued task's Files count.
 *
 * Polls on a slow cadence so the count stays live while a run generates
 * fresh aspect / code-review files, instead of freezing at the value
 * captured when the task was first opened. Mirrors
 * {@link ScreenshotsPollService}; provided locally on
 * `TaskDetailComponent` (no global state).
