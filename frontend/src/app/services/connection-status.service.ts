/**
 * Derives a debounced, app-wide "backend offline" signal from the SignalR hub
 * connection (the connection the browser actually holds to the backend via the
 * proxied `/hubs` route).
 *
 * Why debounce: {@link JobsHubClient.connected} flips false on every transient
 * auto-reconnect (the back-off schedule is 0s/2s/5s/10s/30s), so binding a
 * banner straight to it would flicker. We only declare the backend *offline*
 * once the socket has been down continuously for {@link GRACE_MS}. The flip
 * back to online is immediate — the moment the hub reconnects, the warning
 * clears and {@link JobsHubClient}'s `reconnected` hook re-hydrates the board.
 *
 * Cached data is intentionally NOT cleared while offline: views keep showing
 * what they last loaded (marked stale by the banner) so the operator can still
 * read already-fetched data, per the "backend down must be immediately visible,
 * but viewing loaded data is fine" requirement.
