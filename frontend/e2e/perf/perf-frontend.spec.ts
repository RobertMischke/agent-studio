/**
 * Frontend perceived-latency regression suite.
 *
 * The user's complaint that triggered this file: opening the project-detail
 * panel felt impossible to use, and creating a task took noticeably long.
 * Backend timings looked fine on their own, but the user's seat is in the
 * browser, not the API. This suite measures the user-visible numbers
 * directly:
 *
 *   1. /api/jobs/grouped roundtrip from inside the running app.
 *      Catches Backend regressions that show up as polling lag (5 s
 *      poll interval means anything slower than ~1 s feels permanent).
 *
 *   2. Long Tasks while the project-detail panel is open.
 *      A Long Task is any main-thread block > 50 ms (browser definition);
 *      they are exactly what makes scrolling and input feel stuck. We
 *      observe a 5 s window and require the cumulative blocking time to
 *      stay under 750 ms — generous, but a reliable canary for the kind
 *      of "panel is unusable" symptom the user reported.
 *
 *   3. Click-to-visible for opening the project-detail panel.
 *      Pure perceived latency: how long between clicking the gear and
 *      the panel actually being visible. A second-class regression on
 *      this number is what made the user say "ich komme da nicht hin".
 *
 *   4. Click-to-visible for creating a job.
 *      Same shape, different action. Fixture-only test (no @billable);
 *      we just check the new card appears in 2-ready in time.
 *
 * All ceilings are deliberately loose. The goal is to catch a 10x
 * regression, not to hold the team to a hard SLA. Tighten only after
 * a real regression hits.
