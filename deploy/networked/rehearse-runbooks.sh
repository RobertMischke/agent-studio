# Networked Task Server — operational runbook rehearsal harness.
#
# Turns the certificate-renewal and Runner-secret-rotation runbooks from
# docs/operations/setup/networked-task-server.md into executable, evidence-
# producing steps. Every subcommand appends a timestamped, SECRET-FREE line to
# an evidence log so a rehearsal is auditable after the fact. It never prints,
# stores, or logs a password, session token, enrollment code, or Runner secret.
#
# Subcommands
#   cert-selftest [workdir]
#       Fully self-contained certificate-renewal rehearsal using a self-signed
#       test certificate (no production cert, no network). Issues a "current"
#       cert, simulates ACME renewal by issuing a "renewed" cert with a later
#       expiry, and asserts the renewal invariants (serial changes, new expiry is
#       later, both certs parse, and the 21-day pre-expiry alert threshold is
#       computed). This is the reproducible evidence step — run it in CI or on the
#       host and commit the evidence log.
#
#   cert-check <domain>
#       Live certificate check against a deployed origin (the runbook's
#       `openssl s_client | openssl x509 -issuer -subject -dates` step). Records
#       issuer, subject, and validity window; warns when < 21 days remain.
#
#   rotate <origin> <runner-id>
#       Live Runner-secret rotation rehearsal against a deployed origin. Drives
#       the observable, non-secret half of the runbook through the owner API:
#       mint an overlapping credential, confirm it appears, confirm its
#       last-use after the daemon restart, revoke the OLD credential, and confirm
#       the old credential now carries a revokedAt. The one-time secret is read
#       into a shell variable and never written anywhere. Requires an owner
#       session: export STUDIO_COOKIE (the __Host session cookie value) and
#       STUDIO_CSRF (the CSRF token). The cryptographic fail-closed invariants
#       (old secret -> 401, new secret still claims) are additionally pinned by
#       the deterministic RunbookRehearsalTests in backend.Tests.
